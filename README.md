Here’s a more polished version of your text:

1. We will continue using the existing MT103 messages and publish them to GMG. As GPE, we will take the necessary actions to convert them to MX format to ensure compliance.
2. The support for 94050 has been extended until the end of 2026, so no immediate action is required. GoPay will continue to provide the latest updates.
3. We have not received any MT101 messages at this time. We will need to collaborate with the business and consult with Kopi to determine if there will be any requirements for it in the coming months. 

Let me know if you’d like any further adjustments!a
