**Success Story: Automating Primary Market Data Extraction for the DCM Desk**

To support the Debt Capital Markets (DCM) desk in the US, we developed an automation program that significantly streamlined the process of extracting primary market data. Previously, the DCM team manually extracted data from CFR and Bloomberg to prepare pitch books and DOC reports for issuers and investors. This time-consuming task, which tracked all primary deals in the investment grid, typically took 45 to 50 minutes to complete.

Our team collaborated with the CFR market data provider to onboard their market data API and integrated it with an Excel plugin. This solution automated the extraction and organization of data according to the desk's specific requirements. As a result, we reduced the manual process to under 20 minutes, providing a faster, more efficient workflow for the DCM team and enhancing their ability to respond to market changes in real time.

We continue to work closely with the CFR team and the DCM desk to further enhance this solution, with plans to add new features and improve its efficiency. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of rolling out the automation across other regions to extend its impact and benefits globally.
