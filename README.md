**Subject**: Mailbox Wellness Issue and Recommended Next Steps

Hi Lotus,

Here’s the breakdown of the mailbox wellness issue we encountered yesterday:

1. The original mailbox is nearly inaccessible to everyone due to its size, which is now at 220 GB.
2. According to nd Microsoft standards, shared mailboxes should not exceed 80 GB. Exceeding this limit can lead to severe slowness and an increased risk of mailbox corruption, potentially resulting in the loss of all emails.
3. Since this mailbox has far exceeded the recommended size, Microsoft does not provide support for this scenario.

The best possible solution was to create a new mailbox, rename the existing one, and transfer the original name to the new mailbox. Simultaneously, we are archiving all emails older than a certain date from the old mailbox to prevent a crash. However, there is still a risk of corruption if the archival process does not work as expected.

Therefore, I recommend temporarily granting full access to the old mailbox for all employees so they can transfer necessary emails to the new mailbox via Outlook and continue their day-to-day operations. During this time, we can work with the Exchange team to explore other options for restoring the old mailbox, ensuring older emails remain accessible if needed.

Additionally, we need to consider a deletion strategy. Even after archiving, the mailbox size will still exceed the recommended limit, and the Exchange team will likely ask us to delete more emails to further reduce the size.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
